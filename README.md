# GameKids - An amazing project.
It is a project that I presented in a seminar to show the importance to use the technology to help children to learn.

## Insights :
Developmentally appropriate use of technology can help young children grow and learn, especially when families and early educators play an active role. Early learners can use technology to explore new worlds, make believe, and actively engage in fun and challenging activities.
